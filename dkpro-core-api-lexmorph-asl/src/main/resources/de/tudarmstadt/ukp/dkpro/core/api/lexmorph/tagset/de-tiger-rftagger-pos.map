# TIGER (RfTagger)
#
# This file contains a tag-mapping as it is used by the German model of the RfTagger. 
# The mapping is a modified version of the STTS tagset.
# A fine-grained tag distinction is replaced by the morphological information the RfTagger outputs (e.g. tense, etc.)
# The de-tiger-morph file contains the morphological mappings.
