= Implementing Components

== General

=== Capabilities

All components should declare the types they consume by default as input and they produced by
default as output. Some components may not know before runtime what they produce or consume,
so nothing can be declared here.

== Analysis components

=== Base classes

The base classes for analysis components are provided by uimaFIT: `JCasAnnotator_ImplBase` and 
`CasAnnotator_ImplBase`.

=== Models

The `ModelProviderBase` class offers convenient support for working with model resources. 
The following code is taken from the `OpenNlpPosTagger` component. It shows how the POS Tagger 
model is addressed using a parametrized classpath URL with parameters for language and variant.

The `produceResource()` method is called with the URL of the model once it has been located by
`CasConfigurableProviderBase`.

=== Type mappings

The DKPro type system design provides two levels of abstraction on most annotations: 

* a generic annotation type, e.g. POS (part of speech) with a feature value
  containing the original tag produced by an analysis component, e.g. TreeTagger 
* a set of high-level types for very common categories, e.g. N (noun), V (verb), etc. 

DKPro maintains mappings for commonly used tagsets, e.g. in the module
`de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.lexmorph-asl`. They are named: 


.Naming scheme for tag mapping files
----
{language}-{tagset}-{layer}.map
----

The following values are commonly used for `layer`: 

* `pos` - part-of-speech tag mapping 
* `morph` - morphological features mapping 
* `constituency` - constituent tag mapping
* `dependency` - dependency relation mapping

The mapping provder is create in the `initialize()` method of the UIMA component after the 
respective model provider. This is necessary because the mapping provider obtains the tagset
information for the current model from the model provider.

----

In the `process()` method, the mapping provider is used to to create an UIMA annotation. First,
it is configured for the current document and model. Then, it is invoked for each tag produced
by the tagger obtain the UIMA type for the annotation to be created. If there is no mapping file,
the mapping provide will fall back to a suitable default annotation, e.g. POS for part-of-speech
tags or NamedEntity.

----


=== Default variants

It is possible a different default variant needs to be used depending on the language. This
can be configured by placing a properties file in the classpath and setting its
location using `setDefaultVariantsLocation(String)`. The key in the
properties is the language and the value is used a default variant. These file
should always reside in the `lib` sub-package of a component and use the naming
convention: 

----
{tool}-default-variants.map
----

The default variant file is a Java properties file which defines for each language which variant 
should be assumed as default. It is possible to declare a __catch-all__ variant using `*`. This is
used if none of the other default variants apply.

Use the convenience constructor of `ModelProviderBase` to create model providers that are already 
correctly set up to use default variants:

== I/O components

=== Base classes

The base classes for I/O components are located in the `api.io-asl` module. 

Most reader components are derived from `JCasResourceCollectionReaderBase` or 
`ResourceCollectionReaderBase`. These class offers support for many common functionalities, e.g.:

* common parameters like `PARAM_SOURCE_LOCATION` and `PARAM_PATTERNS`
* reading from the file system, classpath, or ZIP archives
* file-based compression (GZ, BZIP2, XZ)
* handling of `DocumentMetaData (`initCas` methods)
* Ant-like include/exclude patterns
* handling of default excludes and hidden files
* progress reporting support
* extensibility with own Spring resource resolvers

Most writer components are derived from `JCasFileWriter_ImplBase`. This class offers support for
common functionality such as:

* common parameters like `PARAM_TARGET_LOCATION`
* writing to the file system, classpath, or ZIP archives (`getOutputStream` methods)
* file-based compression (GZ, BZIP2, XZ)
* properly interpreting `DocumentMetaData (`getOutputStream` methods)
* overwrite protection
* replacing file extensions

If an I/O component interacts with a different data source, e.g. a database, the base classes above
are not suitable. Such readers should derive from the uimaFIT `JCasCollectionReader_ImplBase`
(or `CasCollectionReader_ImplBase`) and writers from `JCasAnnotator_ImplBase` (or 
`CasAnnotator_ImplBase`). However, the developer should ensure that the component's parameters
reflect the standard DKPro Core reader/writer parameters defined in `ComponentParameters` 
(`api.parameters-asl` module).
