This project was initiated by the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab (UKP) at the Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany under the auspices of Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych.

### What is DKPro and DKPro Core?

*DKPro* was created as the *Darmstadt Knowledge Processing Repository* and first presented at the GSCL 2007. The *Core* part of DKPro addresses tasks that are commonly referred to as *linguistic pre-processing*, e.g. part-of-speech taggers, parsers, etc. Within DKPro Core, a steadily growing set of third-party tools for such tasks have been wrapped into interoperable and interchangeable components for the Apache UIMA framework.

### Who is developing DKPro Core?

For a long time, DKPro Core has been exclusively developed by the members of the UKP Lab. Later, members of the Language Technology Lab, Universität Duisburg-Essen joined in. Since 2014, DKPro opened up to become a community project and has adopted a contributor license agreement approach to contributions.

**We would like to thank [all those who contribute or have contributed](http://github.com/dkpro/dkpro-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.txt) to DKPro Core!**
