Segmenter components identify sentence boundaries and tokens. The order in which sentence
splitting and tokenization are done differs between the integrated the NLP libraries.
Thus, we chose to integrate both steps into a segmenter component to avoid the need to
reorder the components in a pipeline when replacing one segmenter with another.
