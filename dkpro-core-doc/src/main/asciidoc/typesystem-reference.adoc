The document provides detailed information about the DKPro Core type system.

The DKPro Core type system forms the interface between all the integrated components.
Components store and retrieve their data from the UIMA CAS based on this type system. The
type system design is using a rather flat hierarchy and a mostly loose coupling between
annotations. It is offered as a set of modules, not as a single monolithic type system.
