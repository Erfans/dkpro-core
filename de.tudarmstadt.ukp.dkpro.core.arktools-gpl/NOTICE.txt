AQMAR Arabic Tagger

This package provides a sequence tagger implementation customized for Arabic features,
including a named entity detection model especially intended for Arabic Wikipedia.
It was trained on labeled ACE and ANER data as well as an unlabeled Wikipedia corpus.
Learning is with the structured perceptron, optionally in a cost-augmented fashion.
Feature extraction is handled as a preprocessing step prior to learning/decoding.

The tagger was used for the experiments reported in

  Behrang Mohit, Nathan Schneider, Rishav Bhowmick, Kemal Oflazer, and Noah A. Smith (2012),
  Recall-Oriented Learning of Named Entities in Arabic Wikipedia. Proceedings of EACL.

and accompanies the AQMAR Arabic Wikipedia Named Entity Corpus also described in that work;
both can be obtained at

The Java tagger was adapted from Michael Heilman's supersense tagger implementation
for English (http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/mheilman/questions/). It requires a minimum
Java version of 1.6. Feature extraction uses Python and depends on the MADA toolkit
(http://www1.ccls.columbia.edu/MADA/; version 3.1 was used for the Named Entity Corpus).
