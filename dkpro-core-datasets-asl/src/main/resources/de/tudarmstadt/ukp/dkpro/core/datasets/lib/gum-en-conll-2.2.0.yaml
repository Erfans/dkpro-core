      # FIXME having split as an artifact action doesn make so much sense. If the data is
      # distributed over multiple artifacts, it does not work. Even if the data is in one
      # artifact, split always operates on the dataset root - it does not take into account
      # if an artifact has been exploded or not. Thus we need a different includes pattern here
      # than for the explode action above - this seems stuipidly inconsistent
      - action: split
